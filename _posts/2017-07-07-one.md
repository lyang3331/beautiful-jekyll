July 2017 is undoubtedly impressive. Didn't have much thoughts before we were together, but got more than I expected.  

We went dating a lot and spent most time accompanying each other, which seems a little bit weird though because we've only been together for less than a month. 

I will call it fate.

### A Glimpse
BY WALT WHITMAN

A glimpse through an interstice caught,  
Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove late of a winter night,  
and I unremarkâ€™d seated in a corner,   
Of a youth who loves me and whom I love,   
silently approaching and seating himself near,   
that he may hold me by the hand,   
A long while amid the noises of coming and going,   
of drinking and oath and smutty jest,   
There we two, content,   
happy in being together,   
speaking little,  
perhaps not a word.
