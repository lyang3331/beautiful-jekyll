This month is a bitter sweet one. 

Experienced a hard interview and failed...so glad you were there, giving me support and encouragement.

As for the sweet one, of course it's your accompny.


### I loved you first: but afterwards your love
BY CHRISTINA ROSSETTI

I loved you first: but afterwards your love  
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song  
As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.  
Which owes the other most? my love was long,  
And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong; 

I loved and guessed at you, you construed me  
And loved me for what might or might not be –  
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.  
For verily love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’  
With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done,  
For one is both and both are one in love:  

Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’  
Both have the strength and both the length thereof,  
Both of us, of the love which makes us one.
