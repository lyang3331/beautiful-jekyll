Happy birthday to both of us!

Played piano first time in ten years, only for you. Will always remember the beautiful night, the one we shared together, and the more we will share in the future.

-> Love is endless and love is free
-> Love's everything to you and me
-> Love is now and love will always be
-> Love's everywhere to those who see
