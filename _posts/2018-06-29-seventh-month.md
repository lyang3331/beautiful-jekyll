Enjoyed being your little wife.

Such a relaxing month...Trying to figure out what delicacies to cook everyday and simply got satisfied by your smile when you tasted the dinner.

### To My Dear and Loving Husband 
BY ANNE BRADSTREET

If ever two were one, then surely we.  
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.  
If ever wife was happy in a man,  
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.  

I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,  
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.  
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,  
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.  

Thy love is such I can no way repay;  
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.  
Then while we live, in love letâ€™s so persever,  
That when we live no more, we may live ever.
