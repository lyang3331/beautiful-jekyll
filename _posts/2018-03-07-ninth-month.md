Happy 9 months anniversary!

Even though it has been only 9 months, it looks like we have been with each other forever. Do you remember Tavern on the green? Small restaurant inside central park, sparkling lights illuminating the night sky, and your kiss on the cheek.

### Valentine
BY TOM PICKARD

simplicity      
say sleep  

or  
shall we     
shower  

have an apple  

you are     
as I need     
water  

shall I move?     
do you dream?     
shallow snow  

flesh     

melt this
