Time flies.

The past one year was wonderful with you by my side. You’ve given me a reason to smile and a reason to be happy. Just knowing that you love me is enough to make my life complete. Happy one year anniversay!

### Sonnet 18 - Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer’s Day?

BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?  
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:  
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,  
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:  
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,  
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;  
And every fair from fair sometime declines,  
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;  
But thy eternal summer shall not fade  
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;  
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,  
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:  
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,  
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
