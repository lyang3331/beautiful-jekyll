### Poem for My Love
BY JUNE JORDAN

How do we come to be here next to each other     
in the night  
Where are the stars that show us to our love     
inevitable  
Outside the leaves flame usual in darkness     
and the rain  
falls cool and blessed on the holy flesh     
the black men waiting on the corner for     
a womanly mirage  
I am amazed by peace  
It is this possibility of you  
asleep  
and breathing in the quiet air
