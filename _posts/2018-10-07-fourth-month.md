First time traveling!

Though with other people...Still, it was awesome memory in Shenandoah and Great Smoky. Cannot find pretty photoes taken there, but can still remember the surprise brought by happening to meet a bear!

### Yours & Mine
BY ALICE FULTON

Through your lens the sequoia swallowed me     
like a dryad. The camera flashed & forgot.  

I, on the other hand, must practice my absent-  
mindedness, memory being awkward as a touch     
that goes unloved. Lately your eyes have shut  
down to a shade more durable than skin’s. I know you     
love distance, how it smooths. You choose an aerial view,     
the city angled to abstraction, while I go for the close     
exposures: poorly-mounted countenances along Broadway,     
the pigweed cracking each hardscrabble backlot.   

It’s a matter of perspective: yours is to love me      
from a block away & mine is to praise the grain-  
iness that weaves expressively: your face.
